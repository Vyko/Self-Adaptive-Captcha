Self-Adaptive-Captcha
=====================

You need python 2.7, Flask and SQLite3 to run our platform. 

The demo folder contains a SAC folder which is our library written in PHP that communicate with our API.
The choice of PHP to implement our API has been made for showing that our API can be used with any language as it works by webservice and HTTP requests.
The index.php file is here as example for showing how our library can be used. You need an apache server to run it.

You can try this demo at demo.vyko.fr. As it's running on a personal dedicated server, it's possible that sometimes the server is unavailable.
In this case don't hesitate to contact me to re run it at victorsordoillet@gmail.com.
