Self-Adaptive-Captcha
=====================

You need python 2.7, Flask and SQLite3 to run our platform. 
The demo folder is written in PHP and is here as example for showing how our API can be implemented. You need an apache server to test it.

You can try this demo at demo.vyko.fr. As it's running on a personal dedicated server, it's possible that sometimes the server is unavailable.
In this case don't hesite to contact me to re run it at victorsordoillet@gmail.com.
